# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
  - main  # or your branch name

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
  - task: NodeTool@0
    inputs:
      versionSource: 'spec'
      versionSpec: '16.x'
      checkLatest: true
    displayName: 'Install Node.js'

  - script: |
      npm install
      npm run test   # or your test command
    displayName: 'Install dependencies and run tests'
